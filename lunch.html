                <h2>Vegetable Biryani</h2>
                <button>Time: 60 mins</button>
                <p><span class="bold">Step 1:</span><br> Add all the ingredients for the Green Paste and make a smooth paste with cool water.
                    Add Ghee and Oil to the vessel and heat it. Add the dry Biryani spices and roast.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 2:</span><br> In the spices, add the Onions and fry until they turn soft. Then add the rest of the vegetables and fry till they are cooked to 60%.
                    In the fried vegetables, add Salt and the rest of the dry masalas and then switch off the stove.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 3:</span><br> After the stove is switched off, add the Green Paste, frozen Peas, Curd, Lime juice, a tbsp Ghee and Oil and mix well.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 4:</span><br> To cook Biryani Rice, add all the spices and Salt in boiling Water and boil for another 3-4 minutes.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 5:</span><br> In the boiling Water, add the soaked Rice and cook to 80 % in a high flame.
                    Strain the 80% cooked Rice and spread it on the vegetables coated with spices.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 6:</span><br> After spreading the Rice, add some Garam Masala and Ghee and add water from the cooked Biryani Rice and spread it all over the Rice. Add some Orange food colour as well.<br><br>
 
                    <span class="bold">Step 7:</span><br> Seal the edges of the vessel with Maida paste, leaving one spot from where steam can escape. Cover the vessel so that the Dum does not go out.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 8:</span><br> On high flame, the steam comes out of the spot left open. Then reduce the flame and cook for 8 minutes. Then switch off the stove and let it rest for 20 minutes.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="bold">Step 9:</span><br> Then uncover the aromatic Green Biryani and serve with cool Raita.</p>

                <h2>Chicken Biryani</h2>
                <button>Time: 75 mins</button>
                <p><span class="bold">Step 1:</span><br>Coat the marinated chicken with all the spices.Heat oil and reduce the flame and add chicken pieces and fry well to crisp. (The pieces take time to fry)
                    Add oil to the pan and heat it.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 2:</span><br>Add Cumin, chopped Garlic and Green Chillies and fry on a high flame. After the Green Chillies are fried, add chopped Onions and Curry leaves. <br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 3:</span><br> Add the diced tomatoes and cook well. Alternately, you could add 1 tsp of Tomato Ketchup.
                    Add Garlic Ginger Paste, Mirchi Powder, Salt, Coriander Powder, Cumin Powder and Garam Masala.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 4:</span><br> Then reduce the flame completely, add the whisked curd. Keep mixing or the Curd gets flaky.
                    When the Curd is fully mixed with the Spices, add the Fried Chicken and let the pieces get coated with the Spices.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 5:</span><br> Then add a little water and fry until oil separates from the Gravy.
                    When the oil separates, add the chopped Coriander/Mint, a sprig of Curry Leaves and mix well. Add lemon juice and remove from fire.
                    Boil water, add all Spices, Salt, Chopped Mint and Coriander and let it boil on high flame.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 6:</span><br>When the water is boiling, add the soaked Basmati Rice and cook to 60 Percent. (Sixty percent is more than half cooking but the grain should still be brittle).
                    Take a vessel with a thick bottom and strain the 60 percent cooked rice and spread it in a layer.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 7:</span><br> If the Rice is cooked on high flame for another 3 minutes, it becomes 70 percent cooked. Add that layer on to the 60 percent layer.
                    Then add the Fried Chicken. As my Chicken Gravy was dry, I have added 50 ml boiled water. (Biryani tastes good if Chicken has Gravy).<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 8:</span><br> After the rice is cooked, pour the rest of the boiling water, about ½ cup, along the rim of the vessel.
                    Sprinkle 1/4 tsp of Cardamom Powder on the surface. It smells good. (But this is optional.)
                    Dum the Biryani with Tissues, Banana Leaf or Lead plate. Or seal the rim of the vessel with Maida paste and let the Biryani become Dum.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 9:</span><br> In case you are using tissues, sprinkle water and let it Dum for 15 minutes. Out of that 8 minutes can be on high flame, 7 minutes on low flame and let it rest for 15 minutes after the stove is switched off.
                    After 30 minutes in all, turn it over with a flat ladle and serve.
