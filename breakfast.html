                <h2>Idly</h2>
                <button>Time: 22 mins</button>
                <p><span class="bold">Step 1:</span><br> Soak the rice & dal and grind into a paste & combine
                    To prepare this popular South Indian recipe, wash rice and urad dal separately until the water runs
                    clean and add fenugreek seeds to the rice. Soak it in water for 4-6 hours. Soak the urad dal too for
                    the same amount of time. Drain all the water from the urad dal and grind it to a fine paste. Add
                    water accordingly. Grind the rice to a coarse paste (add water as needed) and then mix both the
                    pastes together in a large bowl and whisk them well. Make sure that the consistency is
                    thick.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 2:</span><br>Let the batter ferment, then add salt
                    Now, the idli batter needs to be well-fermented. This step is very important to get soft and fluffy
                    idlis. Keep the batter in a warm place to ferment. Once the batter has risen, add salt to it and
                    whisk to mix it well.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 3:</span><br> Transfer the idli batter in the idli stand
                    Grease the idli stand with oil and take a ladleful of batter and fill the idli mould. Add Â½ cup of
                    water in the idli steamer and let it boil. Put the idli stand inside and close the lid. Let the
                    steam build for 8-10 minutes before switching off the gas.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 4:</span><br> Wait for the utensil to cool a bit before scooping the idlis out
                    If you are using a cooker, use it without a vent and steam it for 10 minutes and then switch the gas
                    off. In both cases, wait till the steam is released before you take the idli stand out. Wait for
                    another 5 minutes and then use a sharp knife to scoop the idlis out. Serve warm with coconut chutney
                    and sambhar.</p>

                <p><span class="bold">Step 1:</span><br> Soak rice, dal and then grind.
                    For this easy recipe, soak the rice and dal overnight. The next morning, grind rice, dal and coconut
                    to make a paste. Add water in batches and grind again to make a batter with a runny consistency. Add
                    salt and mix.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 2:</span><br> Let it ferment.
                    Now keep the mixture in a warm place and let it ferment for 5-6 hours. Once fermented, your dosa
                    batter is ready.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 3:</span><br> Prepare the dosas.
                    Heat a non-stick pan, drizzle some oil on it and pour a ladle full of batter and spread it evenly.
                    Lower the heat and cover the pan for a minute or so. Then dribble a few drops of oil around the
                    dosa. Once it is brown and crisp, the dosa is ready.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Step 4:</span><br> Serve.
                    Serve it with sambar or chutney. Make sure you try this recipe, rate it and let us know in the

                <h2>Aloo Parata</h2>
                <button>Time: 10 mins</button>
                <p><span class="bold">Step 1:</span><br> Prepare the filling
                    To make delicious Aloo Parathas, boil the potatoes at least a few hours before you plan to make the
                    parathas, mash them in a large bowl and cover and refrigerate. Take them out from the fridge and add
                    chopped onions, coriander leaves, salt, garam masala powder and red chilli powder. Mix well so that
                    no lumps remain. Ensure that you have finely chopped the onions or the filling will fall
                    out.<br><br>
                    <span class="bold">Step 2:</span><br> Knead a soft dough and roll a chapati and fill with the stuffing
                    Put wheat flour in a large mixing bowl. Add water gradually and knead into a soft dough. Make
                    small-medium balls of the dough and roll them out into 3 to 4-inch circles. Add a spoonful of potato
                    filling in the centre. Gradually press the rolling pin on all sides while making the parathas. Be
                    very careful to apply pressure evenly. It is very important to ensure that your potato mixture is
                    mashed well and not lumpy or you will never be able to make perfect parathas. Seal the dough and
                    round it with your fingers. Now, roll them with a rolling pin into round parathas.<br><br>
                    <span class="bold">Step 3:</span><br> Pan fry the Aloo Paratha
                    Heat an iron tawa and roast the parathas, cooking them on both sides with a spoonful of olive oil.
                    If you want to use less oil on the parathas, first roast them on both sides on low flame and when
                    they are slightly crispy, apply olive oil with a kitchen brush on both sides. You must keep the
                    flame low.<br><br>
                    <span class="bold">Step 4:</span><br> Serve hot with curd, pickle and chutney
                    Serve piping hot parathas with chilled yoghurt or pickle. You can also serve the aloo parathas with
                    green chutney or coconut chutney or a light gravy. Ideally, a light potato shorba goes best with
                    aloo ka paratha. You can also make quick onion-tomato-green chilli raita that tastes amazing with
                    this paratha.<br><br></p>
